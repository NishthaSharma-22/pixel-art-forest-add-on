## forest pixel art add on

this is a little project that adds and updates a forest themed pixel art image to the readme every 24 hours.

i had fun learning about cron jobs, making apis and making updates

here is the api made specifically for the project - [forest pixel art api](https://github.com/NishthaSharma-22/forest-api)
